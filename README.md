# O-dot: Hands-Free Eye-Tracking Interface with Smart Ring Control

O-dot is a hybrid hardware-software interface that replaces the traditional mouse using just your eyes and a smart ring. The system lets users control a computer cursor by tracking their gaze through a webcam and execute mouse actions using a finger-worn smart ring. Ideal for accessibility, productivity, and even couch computing.

## What It Does

- Uses webcam-based gaze tracking to detect where the user is looking on the screen.
- A smart ring with three physical buttons maps to left-click, right-click, and scroll interactions.
- Users simply look at an element on screen and click via their ringâ€”no need to move a mouse or touch a trackpad.

## Why This Exists

Current interfaces like mouse and touchpad arenâ€™t practical for all environmentsâ€”TVs, AR/VR, physically challenged users, or even when you're lying back and don't want to move. O-dot reimagines human-computer interaction for accessibility, convenience, and futuristic interaction.
